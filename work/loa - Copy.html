        <p id="agreementContentParagraph">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Agreement, the host department is retaining the services of <strong><span id="personNameDisplay">[NAME]</span></strong>, as part of the Canada’s Free Agents program, pursuant to discussions between the host department and the home department to have the Free Agent undertake the work described in Annex A of this Agreement for the benefit and at the request of the host department.</p>
        
		<h2>2.0 Administrative responsibilities of the home department and the Free Agent</h2>
		<p>2.1 The home department remains the Free Agent’s substantive employer and shall be responsible for managing the Free Agent’s human resources (HR) file, which includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>approving leave requests</li>
			<li>completing the performance management agreement, with input from the host manager</li>
			<li>providing regular training and development opportunities</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>2.2 As an indeterminate employee of the home department, the Free Agent has certain responsibilities, including but not limited to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>returning to the home department as needed</li>
			<li>returning to the home department periodically during business hours to ensure that their IT equipment is up to date</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3.0 Administrative responsibilities of the host department</h2>
		<p>3.1 For acting assignments only: If the Free Agent is working at a level that is higher than the employee’s substantive level, the host department is responsible for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ensuring the Free Agent meets merit and has been assessed as a fit for the opportunity</li>
			<li>undertaking the related staffing action</li>
			<li>ensuring that the signed letter of offer has been submitted to the home department a minimum of 10 business days prior to its effective date to allow for HR-to-Pay data entry deadlines to be met (to mitigate pay issues for the Free Agent)</li>
