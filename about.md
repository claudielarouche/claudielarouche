## Hi, I'm Claudie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech-savvy public servant, creative thinker, and community builder based in Ottawa. I love turning complex problems into simple, efficient tools â€” especially when it helps others navigate everyday life more easily.

By day, I work in IT and data within the Government of Canada, where I focus on open government, Power BI dashboards and automation. Outside of work, I build tools like library program finders and playgroup locators, using GitHub Pages, JavaScript, and a splash of AI magic.

I'm also a parent, a language lover, and I love dragons. 

Whether it's organizing a dance class directory or inventing a 12-weeks recurring meal-planning system, I'm always trying to experiment!

This site is where I document my projects, share my thoughts, and encourage others to build what's missing. If you've got an idea and want to make it happen â€” you're in the right place!

Vous pouvez me parler en franÃ§ais! :)
