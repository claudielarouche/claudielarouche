## What Is the Free Agent Program?

The **Free Agent Program** is an innovative approach to talent mobility within the Government of Canada. This approach allows pre-qualified federal employees, known as “Free Agents,” to support Government of Canada departments quickly and easily with their work. As a Free Agent, I bring specialized expertise in IT project management, data analysis, and digital service design to help teams accelerate their goals, share best practices, and deliver value faster.
