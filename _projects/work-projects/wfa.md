Hello!

I created this website to help all the Government of Canada employees affected by WFA. Please share this link with colleagues who might benefit from this.

If you are aware of a resource that is missing from this page, please let me know at [claudielarouche@gmail.com](mailto:claudielarouche@gmail.com).

I will continue updating this web page as I discover new resources.

## What can you do now?

1) Capture facts from your letter 
- Date of the letter 
- Your status (for example affected, opting, surplus) 
- Whether the letter states a guarantee of a reasonable job offer 
- Any explicit deadlines 

Create your own copy of my [WFA Strategy Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKV10MLZ37y9fpw_t7QRubA11iTwjBnk5LReo3w4ETY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to help you capture all the information you will need. 

2) Identify which rules apply to you 
- Confirm your union 
- Check whether your protections sit in a WFA appendix of your collective agreement or in the NJC Work Force Adjustment Directive 

3) Book conversations 
- Meeting with your manager to clarify status and expectations during the transition 
- Meeting with your HR advisor or departmental WFA coordinator 
- Call or email your union representative and ask specifically for WFA support, referring to their WFA guides and FAQ pages  

4) Understand your options as an opting or surplus employee 
From the Work Force Adjustment Directive and union FAQs you will see three classic options for an opting employee, including a twelve month surplus priority period, transition support payment, and combinations that include an education allowance, subject to detailed conditions. 

5) Get clarity on priority entitlement and registration 
- Confirm with HR when your priority entitlement will start 
- You want written confirmation of which situation you are in and by what date you must choose. 

6) Initiate your job search 
- Update your résumé 
- Update or create your LinkedIn profile 
- Update your GC Jobs profile and set up job alerts for keywords that match your skills  

You can use my [WFA Tracking Tool](https://claudielarouche.com/wfa-tool) to help you track all the people you have contacted during your job search.

GOOD LUCK!!!
