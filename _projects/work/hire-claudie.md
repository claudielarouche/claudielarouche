# Hire Claudie

I help public sector and public sector adjacent organizations make sense of their data and turn it into clear information leaders can actually use.

My work sits at the intersection of data, systems, and decision making. I understand how government environments function and I focus on practical outcomes rather than theory or over engineered solutions.

I am also available to build a quick tool that could make your work or life easier.

## What I do

- Clean, structure, and validate messy datasets
- Create clear reports, summaries, and dashboards
- Translate technical or complex data into plain language insights
- Improve and document data and reporting processes
- Step in as temporary capacity when teams are overloaded
- Build lightweight tools and workflows that teams can maintain themselves

## What I am known for

- Strong understanding of government context and constraints
- Ability to move quickly without creating chaos
- Asking the right questions to improve processes
- Producing work that is useful, not just technically correct
- Leaving teams better equipped than when I arrived

## Typical projects

- Turning raw spreadsheets into executive ready summaries
- Cleaning and standardizing reporting data for compliance or planning
- Reviewing existing processes and simplifying them
- Supporting short term initiatives when teams are understaffed
- Bridging the gap between analysts, managers, and decision makers

## Who I work with

- Government departments and agencies
- Government funded organizations
- Consulting firms and vendors serving the public sector
- Teams that need short term support without a long hiring process

## How I work

I work independently, communicate clearly, and respect timelines. My goal is to deliver value quickly and reduce ongoing friction for your team.

## Let us talk

If you are looking for practical help with data, reporting, or process improvement, I am happy to have a short conversation to see if there is a fit.
