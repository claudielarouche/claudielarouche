## Summary

- Valerie Gideon serves as Deputy Minister of Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs and President of FedNor, the regional economic development agency for Northern Ontario, and is a member of the Gesgapegiag First Nation in Quebec's Gaspé region.
- The Inuit Nunangat Policy was created to establish core elements that would make the relationship between federal public servants and Inuit more successful, effective, and responsive to Inuit needs and priorities.
- For many years, federal public servants lacked understanding and recognition of Inuit and the Inuit homeland, so the policy serves as an educational tool to address this gap.
- The policy provides clear guidance to public servants on how to adapt their policies and programs to achieve successful outcomes for Inuit across Inuit Nunangat, the Inuit homeland.
- Previous federal models, such as secretariats for Inuit affairs including one for Inuit health at Health Canada, failed because they marginalized the issues and provided no power or funding to the public servants working in those offices.
- The current policy takes a horizontal approach that creates cooperation between multiple federal departments and agencies, fostering a sense of ownership in policy implementation across government.
- There are now significantly more public servants aware of the Inuit context and needs compared to the past, with real enthusiasm to support Inuit communities that was not previously evident.
- The policy received overwhelmingly positive reception and rapid advancement through government approval processes, including recent announcement of a cabinet directive for implementation of the Inuit Nunangat Policy.
- The main barriers are anticipated to be in the implementation phase, including maintaining continued momentum, sustaining it as a public service priority, and managing leadership changes on both the federal side and within Inuit Treaty organizations.
- Successful implementation will require securing resources for training public servants, including through educational initiatives, and maintaining consistent representation in central agencies during preparation of cabinet documents and Treasury Board submissions.
- The initiative has demonstrated exceptional openness and need within the public service to better understand Inuit context, needs, and priorities, with many public servants showing deep interest despite never having worked directly with Inuit peoples.
- Past challenges included funding initiatives with insufficient resources to succeed in an Inuit Nunangat context, with assumptions made about pan-Indigenous approaches or Canadian mainstream programming that failed to account for the unique Inuit homeland context.
- Previous ineffective approaches led to discouragement among public servants who would try initiatives that failed and then give up, believing successful engagement with Inuit was not achievable.
- Without this policy, there is a risk of returning to the status quo approach, leading to increased frustration among Inuit who do not see themselves represented in the Canadian democratic system or their governments recognized.
- A major risk of not implementing the policy is litigation, as failure to honor legal obligations in treaties negotiated with Inuit across Canada could result in court cases, dispute resolution, and compensation payments for treaty breaches.
- The treaties with Inuit were reached in amicable and transformative ways and represent an incredible asset for Canada, making their successful implementation critical for both the country and Inuit peoples.
- The policy specifically addresses Inuit needs because their lands and treaties are truly distinct, and this approach has received tremendous support from First Nations and Métis nations who recognize this distinction.
- The policy does not detract from ongoing initiatives with First Nations or treaty negotiations with Métis nations in the Prairies, as each Indigenous group requires models that meet their distinct needs.
