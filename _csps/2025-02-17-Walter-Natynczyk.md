## Summary

- Walter Natynczyk was born and raised in Winnipeg, where he delivered newspapers, played football, and worked at restaurants while attending Air Cadets, which introduced him to military life
- His father passed away when he was nine years old, leaving the family on social welfare with strict financial limitations, making military college an affordable path to higher education
- He initially wanted to become a pilot but discovered he had color vision issues that prevented this career path, though he found he enjoyed the structure, discipline, and leadership opportunities in military life
- After struggling academically in his first year at Royal Roads Military College due to inadequate preparation and too much focus on sports, he switched from engineering to arts and from air force to army as a tank officer
- He completed his education at two military colleges, Royal Roads in British Columbia and Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean in Quebec, while training as an armour officer during summers
- His first combat experience was in Cyprus in 1989 as a UN peacekeeper, where he was struck by an electric cattle prod while holding the line between Turkish riot police and Greek civilians
- He served in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1994 during active conflict, experiencing artillery fire and navigating dangerous areas including Sniper Alley in Sarajevo to attend military meetings
- During his year-long deployment in Iraq in 2004, he commanded 35,000 American troops in combat support roles and witnessed the randomness of combat when chaplains he had just spoken with became casualties
- His motivation for military service stems from gratitude for Canada providing a home to his parents after World War II, where his Polish father and German mother had fought on opposite sides
- He learned that effective leadership means understanding and enabling the success of the most junior personnel in an organization, providing them with necessary tools and resources
- Early in his career, he observed how some officers became entitled and difficult to work with after promotion to higher ranks, losing the trustworthiness they had as junior officers
- During an Arctic exercise in extremely cold conditions, he directly questioned a general about at what rank officers tend to become problematic, leading to an honest discussion about military leadership
