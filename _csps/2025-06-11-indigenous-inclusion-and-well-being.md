## Summary

- The event is moderated by Lorenzo Ieraci, Assistant Deputy Minister of Policy, Planning, and Communications Branch at Public Services and Procurement Canada, and takes place on traditional Anishinabe Algonquin territory in Ottawa.
- Elder Verna McGregor from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg opens the session, sharing that she began her public service career in the late eighties but left after only a year due to workplace issues and lack of policies addressing racism at that time.
- Elder Verna emphasizes the importance of Indigenous languages, noting that the Algonquin language has three pages describing water alone, demonstrating how Indigenous languages carry extensive traditional knowledge that is now sought after for addressing climate change and species extinction.
- The Elder explains that ancestors foretold there would be a seeking of traditional knowledge in current times, making Indigenous retention, inclusion, and well-being particularly important now.
- Elder Verna draws on banking industry experience to explain that 95% of people with complaints simply leave rather than voice concerns, which translates to retention issues in the public service context where Indigenous peoples have one of the lowest representation rates.
- The opening prayer honors the four directions, four seasons, four colours of people on earth, and four elements (earth, water, fire, air), emphasizing that these elements are essential for life and bind all humanity together regardless of differences.
- Elder Verna teaches that all people were given instructions to be caretakers of the earth and that despite differences in skin color, beliefs, languages, and histories, humanity is connected through sharing the earth and its elements.
- The teaching explains that humans are 72% water, COVID demonstrated how air connects everyone, fire represents both the internal fire of earth and sun as well as personal internal fire, and the public service role involves looking after collective well-being through legislation and policy.
- Michael Mills introduces himself as Associate Deputy Minister with Public Services and Procurement Canada with over 25 years of federal government experience, serving as Champion of Reconciliation at PSPC and proudly representing his Métis heritage from Manitoba.
- Iliana Lauriston introduces herself as Senior Mental Health Advisor for Service Canada with 17 years in federal government, having previously worked for 10 years in various Indigenous communities including with the Dene in Northwest Territories, Inuvialuit in the North, Cree in northern Quebec, and Mohawks in Montreal.
- Dylan Jenkins introduces himself as a Cree Anishinaabe Bear Clan member from North Bay, Ontario, now in his 25th year of public service as manager of the Inclusive Innovation Team at the National Research Council's Industrial Research Assistance Program.
- Dylan describes his work as connecting people with purpose, empowering people to be their own hero, and moving toward a more humanized public service through integrating Indigenous teachings from various Elders as a two-spirit knowledge keeper.
- Dylan explains his approach as braiding his experiences as an Indigenous person with his Welsh and Scottish roots to make Canada better through shared understanding while acknowledging many truths still need to be shared.
- When asked about people-centric approaches reflecting Indigenous values, Dylan explains that storytelling is fundamental to both Indigenous governance and human nature, as people are naturally wired to share stories about themselves.
- Dylan notes that traditional Indigenous governance structures always included everyone because interconnected systems inherently involve inclusion, and that inclusion is not a thing but an action involving inviting people, asking questions, and interacting.
- Dylan emphasizes that storytelling allows people to express their truths without judgment but with discernment, and that Indigenous people love telling stories repeatedly with each telling offering new learning and new ways forward.
- Dylan argues that focusing on people first before process creates workplaces where authentic selves can be brought to work, noting that while the discussion focuses on Indigenous context, creating human-centered workplaces is fundamentally about human beings being human.
