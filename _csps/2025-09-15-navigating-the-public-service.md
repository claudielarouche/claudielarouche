## Summary

- The session is designed for early career public servants to understand the foundations of a successful government career, focusing on essential concepts like the public good, professional neutrality, and the public service bargain
- Dr. Alex Marland from Acadia University and Dr. Jared Wesley from University of Alberta are both former federal and provincial public servants who co-authored "The Public Servants Guide to Government in Canada" 
- The guide was created to help public servants understand how government actually works in practice, bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world application
- Public servants must be non-partisan in their professional roles, setting aside personal political views to serve diligently regardless of which party is in power
- Government is structured as an enormous organization with departments and agencies designed to support ministers, who are the elected officials providing political direction
- The public good is a core motivating principle for public service work, involving helping society and doing good things, but its definition evolves over time and varies by government
- An emerging area of consensus in defining the public good includes respect for treaties, Indigenous rights, and commitments to reconciliation, which looks different across the country
- The public service bargain is a fundamental concept where public servants provide non-partisan advice and loyal implementation to elected officials in exchange for job security and anonymity
- Public servants are not responsible for defining what constitutes the public good - this responsibility belongs to elected officials, cabinet ministers, premiers, and prime ministers
- The role of public servants is to provide quality information and evidence-informed advice to political decision-makers, not to make political decisions themselves
- Public servants must professionally implement decisions even when they personally disagree with them, as long as those decisions are within legal boundaries
- The public service bargain originated in the UK, evolved in the United States, and was adapted uniquely in Canada over centuries
- Fearless advice requires job security and anonymity protection so public servants can provide honest recommendations without fear of retribution or public exposure
- Public servants should focus on evidence-informed decision-making rather than purely evidence-based decision-making, recognizing that ministers must consider multiple factors including political advice and public opinion
