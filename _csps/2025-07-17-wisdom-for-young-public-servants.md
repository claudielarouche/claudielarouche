## Summary

- Public service work is among the most important and fulfilling work available, and cultivating personal curiosity is essential for success in this field.
- There is vast opportunity to learn both broadly across different areas and deeply within specific domains throughout a public service career.
- Each person who joins the public service brings unique skills and perspectives that were not present before, thereby contributing to the democratic process.
- Today's public servants will need to architect a profound realignment that brings together economic prosperity, social solidarity, and environmental sustainability rather than treating these as separate priorities.
- Public service offers the unique opportunity to have significant impact very early in one's career, with influence that rivals any other occupation as one develops expertise over time.
- Career progression in public service does not necessarily mean moving up the hierarchy, but can involve deepening knowledge and expertise in a particular subject area.
- Career paths in public service are inherently unpredictable, and attempting to plan one's entire career trajectory from the beginning is unrealistic.
- Taking on unexpected opportunities and following interesting work that others may not be pursuing often leads to career success and advancement.
- The public service offers an unparalleled breadth of different job types and experiences, from operations to communications to policy work, all within a single organization.
- Despite the fast pace of work, it is crucial to ensure that recommendations and advice provided to decision-makers have a solid foundation, even though time is always limited.
- The public service creates opportunities for individuals to advance through recognition of hard work and dedication, with one success leading to another.
- Working in the public sector is more rewarding than the private sector because the subjects are more complex, results are harder to achieve, and success in such a challenging environment brings greater fulfillment.
- Regardless of career choice, the goal should be to make a meaningful mark that leaves institutions and the country stronger and makes the world better in some way.
- Actually delivering tangible results and making concrete differences is undervalued but essential, and public servants should be able to point to specific accomplishments they have achieved.
- Others should be able to identify and speak about what a public servant has delivered and recognize contributions that would not have existed without that person's work.
- Public servants must never become cynical because Canadians deserve better, and they should always go the extra mile rather than doing work halfway.
- Serving as a public servant is an honor, and while not every day will be great, the work has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives.
- There are many ways to serve Canada, including through military service, law enforcement, first responders, healthcare, private business, and public service that provides leadership and support to Canadians.
- Following public service values of respect for democracy, respect for people, integrity, excellence, and stewardship enables public servants at any level to provide extraordinary support to Canadians.
