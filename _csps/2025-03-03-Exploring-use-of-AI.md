## Summary

- The video begins with opening remarks and acknowledgements of regional events across Canada related to public service values and ethics. A short video highlights the themes of stewardship and excellence within the public service. Following this, a quick survey is conducted to gauge the audience's current use of artificial intelligence (AI) at work, revealing that a majority use it regularly or occasionally, but a significant portion has never used it.
- The keynote speaker, Dominic Rochon, Deputy Minister and Chief Information Officer at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, emphasizes that public service values and ethics must be the cornerstone of AI use in government. He acknowledges the transformative potential of AI to improve efficiency and service delivery but stresses the importance of responsible and ethical implementation. Rochon provides an overview of the Canadian AI landscape, highlighting Canada's early leadership in AI strategy and the significant investments being made. He outlines the roles of various government departments in the AI ecosystem, including Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Canada (ISED) on regulation and funding, Global Affairs Canada on international standards, and the Canada School of Public Service on training.
- Rochon details the Treasury Board Secretariat's (TBS) guidelines and rules for responsible AI adoption, including the Directive on Automated Decision-Making which mandates fairness, accuracy, and transparency. He also mentions the Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool and the Guide on the use of generative artificial intelligence, which emphasizes the FASTER principles: Fairness, Accountability, Security, Transparency, Education, and Relevance. He provides examples of AI use within the government, such as Employment and Social Development Canada's efficiency gains and Global Affairs Canada's document analysis tool. Rochon clarifies that while AI tools can enhance productivity, they are not intended to replace the public service workforce. He mentions the ongoing consultations for Canada's first AI strategy for the federal public service, focused on people, collaboration, and trust, with a strategy expected in spring 2025. He debunks the myth that public servants cannot use generative AI, emphasizing that it is permitted responsibly and ethically, guided by public service values and the FASTER principles. Rochon introduces a document, "Generative AI in your daily work," available on the Canada School of Public Service website, providing guidance on permissible and impermissible uses of generative AI. He concludes by reiterating the unwavering commitment to ethical and responsible AI, emphasizing the need to connect with policy frameworks and consult with experts.
- Following the keynote, a panel discussion is moderated by Mark Schaan, Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, Artificial Intelligence at the Privy Council Office, featuring Ima Okonny, Assistant Deputy Minister and Chief Data Officer at Employment and Social Development Canada, Natasha Clarke, Deputy Minister at the Department of Cybersecurity and Digital Solutions in the Government of Nova Scotia, and Anna Jahn, Senior Director, Public Policy and Inclusion at Mila, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute.
- The panel discusses the opportunities and considerations for the responsible implementation of AI in a public service context.
	- Ima Okonny highlights the opportunity to leverage AI for the public good, referencing ESDC's use of AI during the pandemic to support Canadians. She emphasizes the importance of transparency, legal compliance, privacy, and security in AI adoption and the need to scale successful AI applications across the public sector. Okonny also underscores the significance of data literacy, data integration, and addressing data drift to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of AI solutions. She points to the potential of AI to target and reach underserved populations by analyzing existing data, while emphasizing the need for collaboration with agencies like StatsCan and careful consideration of diversity and accessibility. Okonny provides an example of using AI for natural language processing to triage cases for vulnerable populations, accelerating their access to benefits. She advocates for focusing on critical issues and leveraging AI and data to drive innovation and solutions.
	- Natasha Clarke shares Nova Scotia's journey in integrating AI, emphasizing that it is a long-term endeavor requiring a shift in thinking from analog to digital government. She stresses the foundational importance of digital literacy and data management in the public service before widespread AI adoption. Clarke advises focusing on the problem and user needs before applying AI, cautioning against the "AI stardust" approach. She highlights the need for policy professionals to understand the implications of AI and encourages public servants to not be afraid to experiment within established guidelines. Clarke discusses early use cases like AI meeting assistants and the need for guidance around their use, especially in confidential settings. She emphasizes the potential for collaboration between provinces and the federal government on digital public infrastructure to address societal challenges. Clarke underscores the importance of data privacy and the need to consider the public good and public protection values alongside efficiency gains. She advocates for a principles-based and values-driven approach to navigate the complexity of AI implementation.
	- Anna Jahn offers a perspective from an AI research institute, Mila, emphasizing the opportunity for governments to respond to societal needs with AI technology, beyond individual user needs. She stresses the critical need for education and training for all public servants to understand AI fundamentals. Jahn advocates for a problem-first approach, viewing AI adoption as a change management process rather than just tool implementation. She suggests thinking of AI in terms of augmentation rather than just automation, keeping a human in the loop. Jahn highlights international examples, such as Singapore's advanced AI adoption and transparency, and the US's AI.gov repository of policies and use cases. She emphasizes Canada's strong AI research ecosystem and the willingness of researchers to collaborate with the government. Jahn underscores the need to translate general principles and values into specific, context-dependent practices within the AI lifecycle.
- The panel then engages in a question and answer session. One question raises the issue of revisiting the meaning of values like privacy in a technologically augmented world. Panelists discuss the need to update legislation, the importance of social license, and the potential for AI to both enhance and challenge privacy considerations, especially in the context of government services. Another question addresses concerns about senior management's focus on AI potentially overshadowing other pressing issues and questions about accountability and learning from past project challenges like Phoenix. Panelists acknowledge the need to do things differently, leverage data to improve service delivery, and focus on digital transformation fundamentals while adopting AI, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes.
- The video concludes with closing remarks from Clerk John Hannaford, who emphasizes the power of stories and meaningful conversations in understanding public service values. He reflects on the current moment of expectations on public institutions and the role of new technologies like AI. Hannaford highlights the importance of bringing values and ethics to life and building a resilient public service. Elder Verna McGregor offers final remarks and a closing prayer, emphasizing the importance of understanding different perspectives and the need for verification in AI-generated information, drawing parallels with past technological adoptions. She underscores the constant nature of change and the importance of evaluating policies and procedures. The session concludes with thanks to the speakers, organizers, and participants, encouraging ongoing reflection and conversation on values and ethics in the public service.
