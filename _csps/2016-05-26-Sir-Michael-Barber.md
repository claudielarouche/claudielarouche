## Summary

- Sir Michael Barber discusses the motivation behind the creation of the Results and Delivery Unit in Tony Blair's government, which stemmed from a need to deliver on promises and ensure that citizens felt a tangible improvement in public services like health and education, moving beyond just passing laws and writing white papers.
- Key challenges in setting up the unit included getting politicians to change their habits and focus on routines, building relationships with a public service initially resistant to a new central unit, and establishing effective data systems.
- To build relationships with the public service, the unit emphasized that it was there to help solve problems, keep the Prime Minister focused, and give credit for successes.
- A fundamental step was getting basic data systems in place, such as consistent crime reporting across police forces.
- Integrating policy development and implementation was achieved through routine checkpoints called "stocktakes," where the Prime Minister reviewed progress, leading to continuous refinement of policy based on what was working. Actionable advice: Don't aim for perfect delivery plans at the start; get them "good enough" and then refine them through routine reviews and data.
- Regarding data and indicators, it's important to get the best data possible to start, but be prepared to refine data systems over time. For long-term goals, identify lead indicators that can show progress in the short term. Actionable advice: Think beyond headline goals and identify short-term indicators that predict long-term success.
- In a federal system like Canada, the delivery approach can help by making the process explicit, clarifying where the federal government depends on provinces and municipalities. Success depends on the quality of dialogue between federal and provincial governments and the extent to which the Canadian people demand delivery from both levels of government. Actionable advice for the federal government: Foster strong relationships with provincial governments and appeal to the Canadian people to create a demand for the agreed-upon agenda
