## Summary

- The event focuses on Red Dress Day 2025 and efforts to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQIA+ people, with presentations from Canadian Indigenous leaders and organizations.
- Elder Verna McGregor from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg shared her personal connection to the issue through the disappearance of two girls from her community in 2008, Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander, which traumatized the entire community.
- Elder Verna emphasized that violence can happen anywhere, not just in distant communities, sharing a recent story about her grandson who alerted school officials to a suspicious person at the school fence who was later arrested.
- Traditional ceremonies that were outlawed during colonization included coming-of-age ceremonies where elders taught young boys their responsibility to speak up and protect young women from harm.
- Elder Verna offered a prayer of thanksgiving acknowledging all elements of creation and expressed hope that healing individuals will contribute to healing Mother Earth, the greatest life-giver.
- Indigenous women in Canada experience disproportionately higher rates of violence across all categories including sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and domestic homicide according to Statistics Canada data.
- Manitoba is considered ground zero for the MMIWG2S+ crisis, with Indigenous women making up some of the highest numbers of murdered and missing Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQIA+ people across Canada.
- Research from the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth shows that 81% of children exposed to intimate partner violence in Manitoba are Indigenous, and this exposure correlates with mental health issues, decreased school attendance and graduation rates, and increased conflict with law.
- In Manitoba, 45% of the unsheltered population are Indigenous with a high portion identifying as women, demonstrating the correlation between poverty and violence.
- In October 2023, Manitoba became the first Canadian province to elect a First Nations premier, Wab Kinew, who appointed two First Nations women to Cabinet positions.
- Minister Nahanni Fontaine was appointed as Minister of Families and Minister Responsible for Women and Gender Equity, bringing her international reputation for advocacy and awareness work for Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse relatives.
- In January 2024, Minister Fontaine appointed Cora Morgan as Special Advisor to Indigenous Women's Issues and Secretary to the MMIWG2S+ and Gender-Based Violence Committee of Cabinet.
- Manitoba established the first-of-its-kind Matriarch Circle in March 2024, bringing together matriarchs from diverse backgrounds and professions with sacred responsibility for prioritizing protection and well-being of Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people.
- The Matriarch Circle includes accomplished Afro-Indigenous, Anishinaabe, Anisininew, Cree, Dakota, Dene, Inuit, and Métis representatives who are knowledge keepers, authors, artists, actors, athletes, and storytellers with expertise in justice, health, and social services.
- The Matriarch Circle meets quarterly during the spring equinox, summer solstice, fall equinox, and winter solstice, and provides regular consultation and guidance on matters related to Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse relatives.
- In May 2024, the Manitoba government announced a $15 million investment to establish the MMIWG2S+ Healing and Empowerment Endowment Fund, managed by the Winnipeg Foundation to continue in perpetuity.
- The endowment fund was established to advance the calls to justice and fund culturally-responsive, trauma-informed support activities for children, families, survivors, and communities affected by MMIWG2S+.
- Each year, 60% of revenue generated from the endowment will be distributed to designated organizations supporting MMIWG2S+ children, families, and survivors, while 40% will fund community-led initiatives by Indigenous-led organizations.
- Designated organizations were identified using a distinctions-based approach to represent First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and urban Indigenous populations with capacity to serve specific geographical locations across Manitoba.
- The fund distribution process is designed to be low barrier and easily accessible, with designated organizations distributing funds directly to immediate family members who have established connections with MMIWG2S+ loved ones.
- The support line for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people is available 24/7 at 1-844-413-6649 for those who need help or support.
