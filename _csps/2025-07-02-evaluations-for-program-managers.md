## Summary

- Program evaluation in the Government of Canada affects most aspects of government operations, from policy implementation to service delivery, and many public servants are directly or indirectly involved in evaluating whether programs work as intended.
- Evaluations should be viewed as learning tools that promote accountability and improve programs serving Canadians, rather than merely compliance exercises or burdens that are disconnected from day-to-day program operations.
- Strong evaluation functions help program managers understand how to reach clients more effectively, run programs more efficiently, and provide evidence to support requests for additional resources.
- When evaluators understand program managers' needs, deadlines, and objectives, they can adapt evaluation methodologies accordingly, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat encourages evaluators to consider a wide range of approaches and methods.
- Evaluation methodologies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches, and program managers should be aware of the full toolbox of methods available rather than assuming evaluations are only quantitative exercises.
- From a strategic policy perspective, evaluation work can identify systemic issues across multiple programs by synthesizing findings from numerous evaluations conducted over several years, including thousands of key informant interviews.
- At Indigenous Services Canada, synthesis of evaluations over seven to eight years revealed common trends such as high staff turnover and lack of flexibility in terms and conditions, which inform medium-term planning and human resources strategy.
- Evaluations for newer, innovation-type initiatives provide opportunities to step back, ask fundamental questions, and get objective advice about what is working well and what needs improvement, particularly when initial assumptions about how change would occur may have been incorrect.
- Effective evaluation requires collaboration and partnership between program evaluators, program managers, and clients or partners who deliver programs and services, while maintaining evaluator objectivity and neutrality.
- The common goal shared by evaluators and program managers is improving services to Canadians and ensuring optimization of financial resources.
- Seeking community participation and co-developing evaluation terms of reference helps ensure the right questions are asked and respects what program clients have experienced.
- Program managers have relationships with partners and key stakeholders, making their close involvement essential, and engaging groups targeted by programs is particularly important in the Indigenous Services context but relevant for all Government of Canada programs.
- The people who benefit from programs, whether Indigenous communities, new immigrants, Employment Insurance recipients, seniors, or other groups, are the experts with the strongest voices and should be centered in evaluation work.
- Good data collection remains challenging but essential for program evaluation, as decision-makers want concrete statistics about how many clients were served, what difference the program made, and whether it was the best approach when programs come up for renewal.
- Designing data requirements early in program development and integrating them into the program structure, including updating performance information profiles, makes a significant difference in evaluation effectiveness when evaluation time arrives.
- Evaluations serve the important but often unrecognized function of documenting a program's complete history and purpose, creating a comprehensive written record that may not exist elsewhere across Government of Canada programs.
- Quantitative data is critical for telling a program's performance story, and working closely with Chief Data Officers and results and delivery teams at the front end ensures appropriate performance indicators are established in Treasury Board submissions.
- Providing input on data requirements at the program design stage gives evaluators a realistic hope of having good solid data five years later when conducting program evaluations.
- New technologies offer significant potential to improve the ability to link data sources and analyze unstructured data, building on foundational pieces like the census of population and surveys of Indigenous peoples for longitudinal studies.
- Qualitative data gathered through individual and small group conversations with partners and key informants generates very rich information that is equally important to quantitative metrics.
- Evaluation methods centered in Indigenous worldviews recognize and appreciate the cultural significance of programs, including culturally important elements like clean water, requiring different ways of gathering data and accepting different forms of evidence.
- Artistic expressions and cultural artifacts created by program clients represent valid and meaningful sources of evidence that should be incorporated into evaluation work alongside traditional data collection methods.
- Evaluators must be mindful of their own biases about what constitutes good data and recognize that credible evidence comes in many forms beyond conventional quantitative measures.
- The Mi'kmaq concept of Etuaptmumk or two-eyed seeing, developed by a Mi'kmaw elder, represents an approach that combines Indigenous knowledge systems with Western evaluation methods to see the best of both perspectives.
