## Summary

- The Canadian School of Public Service developed a program to help federal executives understand that the global strategic environment has changed dramatically, requiring public servants to update their mental models from previous eras
- Traditional boundaries between civilian and military spheres have completely broken down, as demonstrated by the weaponization of everyday devices like pagers and cell phones, creating challenges for existing international law and institutional frameworks
- The incident involving exploding pagers illustrates how consumer electronics can become weapons when distributed through global supply chains, affecting both intended targets and innocent bystanders including family members
- Global supply chains that enabled efficient just-in-time manufacturing from the 1990s onward have created significant vulnerabilities, as seen during COVID-19 when Canada lacked basic supplies like masks despite the simplicity of manufacturing them
- The internet and connected devices have created a world where approximately 4 billion people are connected, but security was not considered during the initial design phase, making everything from garage door openers to pacemakers potential security risks
- Efficiency-focused economic models led to the elimination of redundancy, backup systems, and domestic manufacturing capacity, leaving countries vulnerable when supply chains are disrupted during crises
- Technology companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon maintained stockpiles of medical supplies because they conducted vulnerability assessments and identified potential risks to their operations and workforce
- The challenge for governments is determining how much additional cost they are willing to pay to reduce vulnerabilities while maintaining economic efficiency, as complete security would require securitizing everything in the economy
- Public servants across all departments, from forestry to science to economics, must now consider geopolitical and security implications in their work because the people and entities they interact with globally have changed
- Modern security threats extend beyond traditional military concerns to include data collection and influence operations, as exemplified by debates over platforms like TikTok collecting Canadian user data and potentially transmitting politically influenced content
