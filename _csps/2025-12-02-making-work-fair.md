## Summary

- The speaker introduces Siri Chelazi, a Harvard researcher and expert in advancing women and promoting gender equity in organizations through evidence-based approaches
- The presentation begins with the story of Astred Linder, a Swedish engineer who created the world's first female crash test dummy to address the safety gap where women are more likely to be injured in car accidents despite being in fewer accidents overall
- Car safety regulations worldwide only require testing on crash test dummies modeled after the average male body, which explains why women face higher injury rates in accidents
- Linder's creation of a female crash test dummy has inspired other researchers and car companies to develop more diverse testing models, making traffic safer for everyone
- Making work fair is not about special programs or events, but about embedding fairness into everyday work processes like emails, meetings, feedback, performance reviews, hiring, and promotion decisions
- Fairness is defined using a running race analogy where all competitors should start at the same starting line with equal resources and conditions, rather than some runners being disadvantaged by having to run barefoot, on grass, or from a position further back
- The Broward County school district example demonstrates how system changes can reveal hidden talent by switching from a referral model to universal screening for identifying high-potential students
- Under the referral system, parents or teachers could nominate first and second graders for IQ testing, but this led to underrepresentation of talented students of color
- When Broward County implemented universal screening where all first graders automatically took the same IQ test, participation of Black students in the high IQ program increased by 80% and Hispanic students by 130%
- The European Central Bank case study shows how setting a voluntary goal of 30% women in management roles led to promoting higher-performing women who had previously been overlooked in favor of mediocre men
- Women promoted during the goal period had higher salary trajectories than their male peers, indicating the bank had been missing top female talent before implementing the systematic approach
- Without fairness, true meritocracy cannot exist because it requires accurately identifying people's skills and giving equally skilled people equal opportunities to develop and contribute
- The framework for making work fair consists of three components: making fairness count, making fairness stick, and making fairness normal
- Making fairness count means treating fairness with the same seriousness and tools used for core business functions, including data collection, goal setting, incentives, transparency, and accountability
- The example of Roz Atkins at BBC News illustrates how he started collecting data on guest representation during his nightly news show by spending two minutes after each broadcast counting and categorizing the people featured on air
