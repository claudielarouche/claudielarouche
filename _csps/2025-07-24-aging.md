## Summary

- Two-thirds of all people in human history who have ever lived past 65 years old are alive today, making longevity a rare and recent phenomenon in human experience.
- In the 1950s, most people died within three to five years after becoming old, and nearly all current institutions were designed based on this short post-retirement lifespan paradigm.
- Current generations are living approximately 10 years longer than their parents' generation and nearly 20 years longer than their grandparents' generation.
- Some futurists predict that children born today could live past 150 years, while other longevity scientists believe humanity is entering an era of longevity escape velocity where each year alive adds 1.1 years to life expectancy.
- Experts predict that conventional definitions of young and old, unchanged since the 1950s, will become obsolete by 2030, largely driven by millennials turning 50 at that time.
- The combined purchasing power of the global population over 50 years old would represent the third largest economy in the world after China and the United States, yet institutions remain designed for outdated demographic models.
- In 2025, Canada enters the category of super-aged society, defined as having more than 20 percent of the population over 65 years old, joining approximately 40 other countries in this unprecedented demographic status.
- Throughout 99.9 percent of human history, most people did not survive past 20 to 25 years of age, meaning human biology and social constructs were never designed for current longevity levels.
- The presentation draws from research conducted while the speaker worked as the first futurist in home care and seniors care in Canada with SE Health, culminating in a book called The Future of Aging.
- The futures methodology involves starting with possible future scenarios and working backwards to determine current policy needs, rather than projecting forward from today's conditions to predict future demand.
- Traditional planning for demographic shifts focuses on predicting increased volume and demand for services based on current conditions, then creating new supply to absorb that demand.
- Futurist planning examines all possible ways society may emerge given various drivers, then identifies policies needed today to align with preferred futures or avoid undesirable outcomes.
- Aging is occurring on an exponential curve that doesn't feel dramatic within individual 70 to 80 year lifespans, but represents unprecedented growth when viewed across human history.
- The research collected over 350 signals rather than trends, with signals representing emerging patterns not yet fully manifested, which coalesced into five major themes.
- The five themes identified were aging and communities including built environment, health care, technology, the economy of aging and labor force participation, and the identity of aging.
- The identity of aging chapter, written as chapter five, should have been chapter one because it underpins all other themes and represents a fundamental shift in how society views older adults.
- Ageism will undergo a major societal reckoning similar to how racism and sexism have evolved, though this transformation is still emerging and varies globally with some places moving backwards.
- The City of Toronto created a campaign featuring fake aging cream to highlight workplace ageism, revealing that 41 percent of older adult Canadians report feeling ignored.
- Research identified four major shifts in the identity of aging including moving from reflection on late life to multiple personal reinventions throughout older age.
- Another shift involves moving from knowledge accumulation as a goal in itself to recognizing the wisdom of elders as creating massive societal value, drawing from Indigenous populations worldwide.
- Sexuality among older adults is experiencing emancipation after multiple generations of trauma around not enacting one's sexual identity.
- The final identity shift involves moving from goals of avoiding death to having power and agency over what end of life looks like from beginning to end.
- In the Netherlands in 2017, a motivational speaker named Emile Ratelband petitioned the government to allow people to legally change their age, arguing he could change gender and name but not age despite not feeling or being biologically 69 years old.
- The City of Boston launched an Age Strong campaign to establish a different identity for aging through imagery, language, and playfulness about what it means to be an age-strong city.
- The methodology involved partnering with research and design firms to let data tell the story rather than imposing predetermined topics of investigation on the research.
