## Summary

- The National Day for Truth and Reconciliation is observed annually on September 30th in Canada to honor residential school survivors and acknowledge lasting impacts on Indigenous communities

- Economic reconciliation goes beyond traditional economic development and stems from Indigenous creation stories and the role of being caretakers of the Earth

- Indigenous peoples were given original instructions to be caretakers of the Earth, and reconciliation includes remembering these roles

- Reconciliation extends beyond what was done to Indigenous peoples to include what humans have done to the Earth and other nations (animals, trees, etc.)

- Progress in reconciliation has been made over the past 10 years since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, but advocates want faster movement

- The public service has a responsibility to maintain progress and work daily for future generations in reconciliation efforts

- If reconciliation efforts are ineffective within the public service, it cannot be expected to succeed in other sectors

- Indigenous data sovereignty and digital inclusion are central to economic reconciliation work

- Indigenous communities must be able to steward their own data and protect their stories and history

- Residential school survivors are becoming fewer in number, and someday there will be no more survivors

- The residential school system attempted to "kill the Indian in the child" but could not kill resilience and spirit

- Economic reconciliation means ensuring Indigenous peoples have access to tools, training, and opportunities to thrive in today's economy

- Programs like the Indigenous IT Apprenticeship translate reconciliation into real opportunities, skills, and change

- Any modification of reconciliation concepts requires caution to ensure they remain truly Indigenous-led

- Building healthy, reciprocal relationships is key to reconciliation

- Recognition and respect for Indigenous peoples in the past, present, and future are essential elements
