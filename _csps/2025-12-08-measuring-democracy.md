## Summary

- The presentation explores how democracy is measured globally, examining the relationship between expert assessments and public opinion in the context of growing concerns about democratic decline
- Three major democracy measurement systems emerged from Cold War tensions in the 1970s, with significant expansion after Donald Trump's 2016 election sparked increased academic interest in democratic measurement
- Freedom House, one of the earliest democracy indexes, was created to categorize countries by their degree of freedom and is funded by the US government, leading to potential conflicts of interest between promotion and measurement roles
- Freedom House measures democracy through political rights including electoral processes and government functioning, and civil liberties including freedom of expression and association, using 172 questions across 25 concepts
- Research indicates Freedom House shows bias favoring US allies while discriminating against Muslim and socialist countries, raising questions about the objectivity of expert-based measurements
- Polity, another major index founded around the same time as Freedom House, focuses primarily on electoral processes and is funded by the CIA through the Political Instability Task Force
- Polity measures democracy through three main components: competitive elections, constraints on executive power, and regulated political participation, taking a more factual approach than Freedom House
- Varieties of Democracy emerged in 2017 as a scholarly initiative between American and Swedish universities, involving over 4,000 experts and recognizing multiple types of democracy including electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian forms
- The three major indexes show different regional trends, with Polity indicating stable or rising democracy levels in most regions, Freedom House showing slight declines globally, and Varieties of Democracy reporting moderate declines since 2013
- Expert measurements reveal significant variation in democratic levels within regions, with Western countries showing minimal variation while other regions display much greater diversity in democratic scores
- Public opinion data from international surveys with over 2.5 million respondents shows different patterns than expert assessments, with countries like Tanzania, Botswana, and Vietnam scoring highly on citizen satisfaction with democracy
- Regional analysis of public attitudes shows concerning declines in satisfaction with democracy in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, while other regions show mixed patterns
- The disconnect between expert assessments and public opinion suggests that measuring democracy is complex and that different methodologies can produce varying conclusions about democratic health globally
