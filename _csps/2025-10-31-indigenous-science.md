## Summary

- Dr. Myrle Ballard is a Canada Research Chair and associate professor at the University of Calgary, trained in both Western and Indigenous science, who served as the first Director of Indigenous Science Division at Environment and Climate Change Canada from 2022 to 2024
- Indigenous science is distinct from Indigenous knowledge systems and traditional knowledge, representing real-time, constantly evolving knowledge held by Indigenous peoples since time immemorial about lands and waters
- Indigenous peoples serve as first responders to environmental changes due to their close connection with the land, bringing forward knowledge so others can act upon it
- Indigenous science incorporates both qualitative and quantitative methods, similar to Western science but with different approaches, such as using all five senses when making medicines and monitoring environmental conditions
- The knowledge is built through iterative processes over time, with Indigenous peoples maintaining continuous presence in areas while Western scientists may only visit temporarily
- Place names in Indigenous languages like Anishinaabemowin contain specific environmental and ecological information that reflects the original conditions and functions within ecosystems
- Three-Eyed Seeing framework expands beyond Two-Eyed Seeing by incorporating Indigenous science, Western science, and the voice of relations which includes all non-human elements like lands, waters, and species
- Relations refers to everything in the environment besides humans, and Indigenous peoples understand they live with and are responsible for these relations
- Indigenous peoples serve as the voice for relations because of their close connection to the land and ability to interpret environmental communications
- Environmental monitoring includes listening to indicators like the sounds of leaves, rain patterns, presence or absence of frogs and birds, and behavior of animals like horses around water sources
- Traditional ecological indicators help identify environmental changes, such as the disappearance of frogs indicating problems with land health or water quality
- Indigenous science emphasizes the importance of experiential knowledge gained through living in an area over long periods, capturing historical changes that temporary scientific visits might miss
- The approach involves learning to listen to what the land and water are communicating rather than only making decisions for them without considering their needs
