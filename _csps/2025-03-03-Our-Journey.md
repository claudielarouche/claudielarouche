## Summary

- The symposium brought together approximately 12,000 public servants from across Canada to discuss values and ethics in federal public service
- Elder Verna McGregor provided Indigenous teachings emphasizing that all people share responsibility as caretakers of the earth and must consider the next seven generations in their decisions
- The meeting takes place on traditional unceded Algonquin territory at the confluence of rivers from four directions, symbolizing balance and traditional governance
- Indigenous teachings highlight that we are all connected through the four elements (earth, water, fire, air) and that public service is about serving the collective good
- The medicine wheel teachings represent balance between emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental aspects, with the spiritual component often missing in modern contexts
- Public servants hold "the highest honour to look after the good of the collective," similar to the meaning of the eagle feather flying highest to the creator
- The Clerk of the Privy Council emphasized the genuine appetite for conversation about identity and role in society among public servants
- Over the past year, there has been a renewed focus on values and ethics discussions at every level of the public service
- The world is increasingly complex with troubling issues, but this presents opportunities for reflection and problem-solving
- Progress requires learning from each other, sharing best practices, and learning from failures
- Accountability and goal-setting are essential for making progress on values, ethics, anti-racism, equity, and inclusion initiatives
