## Summary

- Public service identity is unified by shared values and ethics despite different roles and work contexts across government departments
- The "respect for people" value is critically important but represents an area where the government could be doing better
- Values and Ethics and the Call to Action on Anti-racism, Equity, and Inclusion are intrinsically linked and reinforce each other
- The Call to Action requires intentional action and accountability to move from "me" to "we" thinking
- Progress on equity, diversity, accessibility, and inclusion has been slower than expected but requires continued commitment without pulling back
- Public servants must ensure policies and programming reflect the identities and experiences of those they serve across Canada
- The government acknowledges Indigenous territories and commits to implementing Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action
- Deputy Ministers' Task Team focuses on tough systemic changes rather than just early wins
- The forward direction of the Call to Action asks deputies to set multi-year goals for recruitment, promotion, and inclusion of Indigenous, Black, and racialized employees
- Systemic barriers exist in processes, practices, mindsets, and behaviors that need to be dismantled
- Respect for people means treating individuals with dignity, fairness, and valuing diverse perspectives
- Respect for democracy requires a public service reflective of Canada's diversity at all levels
- Stewardship and integrity require accountability for addressing inequalities and ensuring policies are free from racism and bias
- Excellence cannot be achieved while leaving talented employees underutilized or excluded
- Self-assessments show tangible progress since 2021 including more disaggregated data, targeted recruitment initiatives, increased mentorship opportunities, and new learning offerings
- More Indigenous, Black, and racialized employees have been appointed to executive positions, though this is just a start
