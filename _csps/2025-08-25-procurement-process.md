## Summary

- The session focuses on helping government managers understand their role as "business owners" in the procurement process, which refers to public servants responsible for the business area requiring procurement rather than actual business ownership
- Business owners are defined as public servants who identify a need for goods or services and are ultimately accountable for procurement decisions and outcomes, typically the manager with the budget authority
- Most managers will engage in procurement at some point in their careers, ranging from simple purchases using acquisition cards for office supplies to complex acquisitions like consultants, equipment, or software
- The first critical responsibility of a business owner is determining whether procurement is actually necessary to fulfill their identified need, as there may be alternative ways to obtain required goods or services within government
- Business owners must be able to clearly define and explain their procurement needs in terms that would be understandable to the general public, ensuring the use of government funds is justifiable
- Managers should engage their department's procurement teams early and often in the process, as these experts understand policies, regulations, and compliance requirements
- While procurement teams provide expertise on rules and processes, business owners retain key responsibilities including the decision to buy, defining what to purchase, ensuring delivery, and managing vendor interactions appropriately
- Business owners must consider various policy requirements during procurement including accessibility standards, green procurement policies, and ensuring open and fair competition
- The role of business owner begins immediately when a need is identified, not when the procurement team becomes involved, and requires active participation throughout the entire process
- Managers must maintain awareness of integrity and conflict of interest risks that can arise when money and vendor relationships are involved
- Business owners should ask themselves whether they would be comfortable defending their procurement decisions if called to justify them publicly or to Parliament
- Clear definition of requirements is essential for successful procurement, meaning business owners must specify exactly what they need without necessarily providing excessive technical detail
- The procurement team serves as policy and process experts while business owners remain the technical experts on the specific goods or services being acquired
