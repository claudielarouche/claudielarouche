    - Use the accessibility passport system to document, track, and regularly review changing accommodation needs with your manager
    - Schedule monthly reviews with your supervisor to assess whether current accommodations are working or need adjustment

    - Make a business case to senior leadership when you identify gaps in disability support systems

    - Choose accessible venues for all meetings and events to ensure full participation
    - Create accommodation processes that don't require employees to justify or prove their need for support
    - Develop comprehensive accessibility beyond basic requirements - consider ergonomic assessments, accessible furniture, and convenient bathroom access
    - Advocate for neurodiversity hiring initiatives in professional roles across IT, finance, and other departments
    - Establish regular disability champion meetings and ensure all departments have representation
    - Model accessibility practices that other organizations can learn from and replicate
