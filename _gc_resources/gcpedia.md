## What is GCPedia?

GCPedia is a collaboration tool built using mediawiki, the same platform that wikipedia uses. 

It is only accessible by Government of Canada employees. 

## Should you invest in GCPedia?

Although GCPedia is still accessible, it doesn't seem to be actively maintained (based on when the [Github repository](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcpedia){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} was last updated, February 2025).

GCExchange is meant to replace GCPedia. 

If you are thinking of creating a landing page to present what your team does, if the audience is within your department only, you should probably look into creating a Sharepoint page. You might have to talk to your IT Service Desk to create the page and grant you edit access.

Please note that you can only access the links below from the Government of Canada network.
