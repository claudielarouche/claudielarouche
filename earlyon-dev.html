		<p>Dear parents of Ottawa,</p>
		<p>From November 2023 to end of September 2024, it has been my utmost pleasure to provide a repository of all EarlyON playgroups in Ottawa. As a parent of a young boy born in December 2019, I was extremely frustrated with having to consult 21 different websites to figure out which playgroup was happening when.</p>
		<p>As a Mom who works in IT, I knew there had to be a better way. </p>
		<p>I built the EarlyON repository with lots of help from ChatGPT during the evening and on weekends, on my own personal time. The time commitment never bothered me, I was driven by the knowledge that an EarlyON repository would help so many people.</p>
		<p>And I was right. As soon as I mentioned the my EarlyON Repository on the various Moms Group on Facebook, positive feedback, offers to buy me coffee, great testimonials came pouring my way. I want to thank each and every parent out there who took the time to thank me for putting this website together.</p>
		<p>I also want to take a moment to thank all the EarlyON employees in Ottawa. The work you do for parents of Ottawa is so so so needed. Children are wonderful... but they are also a handful right ;) Having a place to go to talk to other parents who face the same issues we do, and having access to scales to weight our babies, nutritionists to discuss issues we face, nurses, psychologists, for FREE is unbelievable. I cannot thank the EarlyON organization enough for the wonderful work they do for parents around the city. </p>
		<p>I want to take a minute to also thank the EarlyON employees who so patiently responded to my monthly emails I was sending them to ensure I had the most up to date information on their upcoming closure and schedule for the upcoming month. You were all very kind, and your constant words of encouragements really helped keep me motivated to pursue this project. </p>
		<p>As soon as my website was launched, I was contacted by Parent Resource Centre, one of the organizations that offer EarlyON playgroups in the city.</p>
		<p>They were impressed that I had single handedly put together a resource that people had wanted to create for years and they wanted to meet with me to discuss how I had done it and the amount of work needed to keep it going. I offered to give them my code if they were up for doing the monthly upkeep of updating schedules as it changes and marking playgroups as cancelled.</p>
		<p>Parent Resource Centre obtained funding from the province and ended up creating a very similar resource to mine. </p>
