Two long-standing EarlyON centres in Orléans — **Charlemagne** and **Divine Infant**, both operated by the Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) — are closing at the end of November. These closures will leave hundreds of families without essential early years programming.

This page gathers all key information, links, contacts, demands, and actions in one place to support community advocacy.

## 📌 Overview of What's Happening

- OCSB is closing **two EarlyON playgroups:**
  - **Charlemagne**
  - **Divine Infant** (already closed)
- The Charlemagne EarlyOn center currently provides playgroup programming for children age 0-6 Monday through Friday, as well as a baby playgroup twice per week. 
- The Charlemagne EarlyOn has supported families for **over 30 years**.
- Remaining EarlyON centres in Orléans are **already at maximum capacity** or open only **one morning per week**
- No viable alternatives exist for the hundreds of families affected.


## 📣 Parents’ Main Demands

1. **Delay closure** until replacement location is secured.
2. Keep EarlyON funding in Orléans.
    
    
## ❓ Questions That Require Answers from OCSB

- When was this decision made?
- How long has the Board known?
- Why were families, staff, and operators not consulted?
- What alternatives were considered?
- Where is the EarlyON funding being redirected?
- Why not relocate the program to **Chapel Hill** (which has capacity)?
- Why not move it back to **Divine Infant**?

## 📍 Why the Remaining Centres Cannot Absorb Demand

### Centrum (46 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- Over capacity
- Limited days due to French-only programming & sensory-friendly programming
- Cannot absorb hundreds of displaced families

### Orleans Resurrection Lutheran Church (1 hour 14 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- One morning per week (Tuesday mornings)
- No baby program

### Fallingbrook (18 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- One morning per week (Wednesday mornings)
- No baby program

## 💛 Why This Matters

EarlyON centres are essential for:

- Early childhood development
- Language and social skills
- Postpartum mental health support
- Reducing isolation among caregivers
- Providing accessible, no-cost programming

Orléans is one of the **fastest-growing** communities in Ottawa. Closing two centres without alternatives is not sustainable or responsible.
