The Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) is closing two long-standing EarlyOn Centres in Orléans: **Charlemagne** and **Divine Infant**. These closures will leave hundreds of caregivers and children without essential early years programming.

This page gathers all key information, links, contacts, demands, and actions in one place to support community advocacy.

## 📌 Overview of What's Happening

- OCSB is closing **two EarlyON Centres:**
  - **Divine Infant** (closed as of September)
    - Provided playgroup programming for children age 0-6 Monday through Friday 
    - Closed due to difficulty finding staff and duplication of services with the Charlemagne centre 

  - **Charlemagne** (to close at the end of November)
    - Provides playgroup programming for children age 0-6 Monday through Friday, as well as a baby playgroup twice per week 
    - Has supported families for over 30 years at this location attached to St Peter’s High School 
    - Closing as the high school is planning to take over the space
- Both centers were consistently running at or very near capacity.
- Remaining EarlyON centres in Orléans are **already at maximum capacity** or open only **one morning per week**
  - These centers are run by other organizations, and funding that OCSB received through the Ontario EarlyOn Program will not transfer over. **There is no plan to increase services at the remaining center to meet demand.**
- No viable alternatives exist for the hundreds of families affected.
- 🎯 **Impact**: With both Charlemagne and Divine Infant closing, the number of English and bilingual EarlyOn service hours in Orléans will drop from 56 hours per week to 15. 

It is also notable that St. Elizabeth, another OCSB EarlyOn center, closed in September. As a result, **3 of the 6 OCSB-run EarlyOn centers closed abruptly in 2025**, without alternative services secured. 

## 📣 Parents’ Main Demands

1. **Delay closure** until a replacement location is secured.
2. Keep EarlyON funding in Orléans.
   
    
## ❓ Questions That Require Answers from OCSB

- When was this decision made?
- How long has the Board known?
- Why were families and operators not consulted?
- Where is the EarlyON funding being redirected?
- What alternatives were considered?
  - Could the space currently allocated to the EarlyON playgroup be reduced, instead of cancelling the playgroup entirely? 
  - Alternatively, has OCSB considered redefining the school's boundaries (given that there is more capacity at St Matthew High School)? 
  - Why not relocate the program to another Orléans school, such as **Chapel Hill** (which has capacity) or back to **Divine Infant**?


## 🚫 Why the Remaining Centres Cannot Absorb Demand

### Centrum (46 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- Over capacity
- Cannot absorb hundreds of displaced families

### Orleans Resurrection Lutheran Church (1 hour 14 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- One morning per week (Tuesday mornings)
- No baby program

### Fallingbrook (18 minutes walk from Charlemagne)
- One morning per week (Wednesday mornings)
- No baby program

Many users (including daycares) attend playgroup with multiple children and cannot easily use OCTranspo to travel. By the time they arrive, the centre may already be full.

## 💛 Why This Matters

EarlyON centres are an essential service in our community that provide:

- Early childhood education, which supports language, social and emotional skill development, and supports the transition to kindergarte
- Connection with other caregivers, which reduces feelings of isolation 
- Postpartum mental health support
- Accessible, no-cost programming
- Access to advice from professionals trained in early childhood education 
- Information on other resources and services in the community  

Orléans is one of the **fastest-growing** communities in Ottawa. Closing two centres without alternatives is not sustainable or responsible.

## 💬 Testimonials

<div class="testimonial">
  <p class="testimonial-text">"This is such awful news — my heart is heavy. When I first started coming to the Charlemagne EarlyON Centre in 2016, I was a new stay-at-home mum. My girls were toddlers, and I needed the moral support of a caring community of educators and parents. I later met Ms. Kelly and Ms. Karrie when I attended with my youngest, and once again, the community welcomed me with open arms.
Kelly even hired me when I was ready to reconnect with my career, and during that time, I also met Ms. Catherine 🙂. My months working at Charlemagne were just as special as my time attending as a parent — this community truly is the best.
I’ve written to councillors and education representatives because this decision is truly devastating. I’m heartbroken but determined not to let the centre close without a fight."</p>

  <p class="testimonial-text">"I am truly devastated by this news! Ms. Karrie, Ms. Kelly, and Ms. Catherine are such amazing educators — always so kind and welcoming to me and my daughter. I can’t imagine not having this playgroup anymore or not seeing these wonderful educators and fellow parents. This place has meant so much to us. 💛"</p>
