## May 2025

- Created the change log page!
- Added css code for Bootstrap buttons
- The City of Ottawa Library website was changed. All events are now starting with https://booking.biblioottawalibrary.ca/ whereas before they were under https://biblioottawalibrary.ca/ I had to change my CSV file where all the data is located, and also the Python script that I run weekly to update the data. Thankfully the whole exercise took only about 5 minutes, phew! :) 
- Added some more stuff to my media page, including some images. I decided to fix the CSS to make the image appear on the left instead of in the middle of the screen :) 
- Added more social links in the footer
- Created a [Free Agent](https://claudielarouche.com/projects/free-agent/) page
- I recently changed how my website is built. It used to be built with custom HTML and Javascript, but I started using an open-source site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (thank you [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for explaining to me how to migrate my website). This allows me to have "reusable components" for similar pages so that I don't have to constantly copy-paste the same code everywhere (and if that code changes, then I only change it in one spot instead of 17 locations haha). Anyways, long story short, I now have to change all my projects to adopt the new look, so I've been slowly working on that. 
- I decided to create a separate page for [Kindergym](https://claudielarouche.com/projects/kindergym/). And then on each City of Ottawa drop-in page I have, I added a mini menu to go from one to the other (currently, the options are: all drop-ins, skating, swimming, kindergym). I think I should rearrange my home page to put all the City of Ottawa Drop-Ins subprojects within one category. Maybe a task for June haha. I also think I should maybe create more specialized pages like Badminton, Basketball, Pickleball, etc. 
- The 4 City of Ottawa drop-in pages are now coded using "components" instead of HTML code within the page.
- Darn the library website changed again! I had to fix my Python script
- A few days later, I realized I had a bunch of duplicate events in my library data. So I opened the dataset in Notepad++ to do Edit > Line Operation > Remove duplicate, then I re-uploaded the dataset to Github where my website is hosted. 
- I decided to change host! I am now using Netlify instead of Github Pages. For now, I am using the free version. The reason for the switch is that I want to be able to sell stuff, which was not really allowed on Gihub Pages. 
- Just a quick test
- (before that I did tons of stuff but I didn't keep track sorry! ;)
