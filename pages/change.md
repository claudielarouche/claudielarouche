## May 2025

- Created the change log page!
- Added css code for Bootstrap buttons
- (before that I did tons of stuff but I didn't keep track sorry! ;)
- The City of Ottawa Library website was changed. All events are now starting with https://booking.biblioottawalibrary.ca whereas before they were under https://biblioottawalibrary.ca/ I had to change my CSV file where all the data is located, and also the Python script that I run weekly to update the data. Thankfully the whole exercise took only about 5 minutes, phew! :) 
- Added some more stuff to my media page, including some images. I decided to fix the CSS to make the image appear on the left instead of in the middle of the screen :)
