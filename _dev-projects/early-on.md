From November 2023 to October 2024, I maintained the EarlyON Playgroup Repository, a searchable and up-to-date listing of EarlyON programs in Ottawa. My goal was to make it easier for parents to find playgroup information without having to search through 21 different websites. This resource was updated monthly and served many families during its year-long run.

In October 2024, the Parent Resource Centre launched the [Incredible Playgroup Finder](https://incredibleplaygroupfinder.ca), a centralized and more permanent tool built on the same goal: to support Ottawa families.

## üõ† How It Was Built

It all started with a simple question to ChatGPT: "Can you help me build a javascript and HTML website that reads off of a CSV file and presents the data on the screen?" It took 5 or 6 different attempts after that initial question, but finally ChatGPT and I found a way to make it work. 

Once I had a working prototype, I had to find the data. 

I was hoping to automatically extract the information from the 21 different websites, but the format is so different, most of the schedules are on PDF documents, and that was not a viable option. 

Thankfully, most playgroups follow the same logic week after week. 

So what I ended up doing is basically emailing every organization to ask them if they had any planned changes to the schedule for the following month or planned closure. 

Then I'd make the appropriate changes in a Google Sheet document. 

Then I'd export the Google Sheet to CSV. 

Then I'd save the Google Sheet to Github pages. 

...and then the data was up to date for another month :)
