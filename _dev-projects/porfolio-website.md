Todo: 
- Create the product in Paypal and add a link to purchase it
- Add more content to the demo website (blog post and add images and different formating in the text)
- Add "buy now" buttons
- Write documentation

Do you like my website? Would you like to have a similar website for your own projects?  

I would be thrilled to help!  

## How to set it up

1. Create a Github account
  - Navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
  - Click Sign up.
  - Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

2. Purchase your Portfolio Website (keep scrolling). You'll need to include your Github username.

3. Next, I'll set up your portfolio website and give you all the access you need. You can use a Github URL which costs nothing, or you can use a custom URL which would cost you about $20 a year. 

4. Create the content for your website by creating pages in Markdown and by adding pre-programmed components. 

For example, here's how text formatting works in Markdown: 

```
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.
```

And the result:  
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

And here is an example of a pre-programmed component. In this case, the URL, text, colour and size are all customizable:

```
{% raw %}
{% include button.html
   url="http://claudielarouche.com"
   text="Go somewhere fun"
   color="red"
   size="medium"
%}
{% endraw %}
```
And the result:  

{% include custom_button.html
   url="http://claudielarouche.com"
   text="Go somewhere fun"
   color="danger"
   size="medium"
%}

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long will it take for my portfolio website to be setup

Once a purchase is made, my commitment to you is to have everything ready to use within a week.

### Do you provide training on how to customize my website?

All the documentation you will need to customize your website is located here. [TODO: Add link]  

If you still need one-on-one assistance, you can hire me for an hourly fee.

### How is it possible that there is no recurring hosting fee? 

Your portfolio website will be hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you follow the link, it will look very technical. Don't worry, you don't have to know how to do any of this, I will happily do the entire setup for you!

### What if I need a custom component that does not currently exist?

You can purchase additional components any time. For each additional component, I will provide a quote beforehand. But the beauty of it is that if I create a component for one client, I can make it available to ALL clients. New components will be added over time and the documentation page will be updated to demonstrate how to use the component. 

### Can I add new pages to my website?

Yes! As many as you want! And you can customize which page(s) appears in your top menu

### Can I create a blog?

Yes! Your portfolio website also supports blogs

### What if I change my mind and I want a refund after all?

No problem, just ask and I will send you a refund.
