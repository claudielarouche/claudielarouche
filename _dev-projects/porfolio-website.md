Do you like my website? Would you like to build your own for your own projects?  

I would be thrilled to help!  

## How it works

1. You create a Github account (instructions coming soon)

2. You send me the link

3. I set up your portfolio website and give you all the access you need. You can use a Github URL which costs nothing, or you can use a custom URL which would cost you about $20 a year. 

4. You create the content of your website by creating pages in Markdown and by adding pre-programmed components. 

For example, here's how you would format text:

```
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.
```

And the result: 
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

And here is an example of a pre-programmed component. In this case, the URL, text, colour and size are all customizable:

```
{% raw %}
{% include button.html
   url="http://claudielarouche.com"
   text="Go somewhere fun"
   color="red"
   size="medium"
%}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include custom_button.html
   url="http://claudielarouche.com"
   text="Go somewhere fun"
   color="danger"
   size="medium"
%}

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long will it take for my portfolio website to be setup

Once a purchase is made, my commitment to you is to have everything ready to use within a week.

### Do you provide training on how to customize my website?

All the documentation you will need to customize your website is located here. [TODO: Add link]  

If you still need one-on-one assistance, you can hire me for an hourly fee.

### How is it possible that there is no recurring hosting fee? 

Your portfolio website will be hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you follow the link, it will look very technical. Don't worry, you don't have to know how to do any of this, I will happily do the entire setup for you!

### What if I need a custom component that does not currently exist?

You can purchase additional components any time. For each additional component, I will provide a quote beforehand. But the beauty of it is that if I create a component for one client, I can make it available to ALL clients. New components will be added over time and the documentation page will be updated to demonstrate how to use the component.
