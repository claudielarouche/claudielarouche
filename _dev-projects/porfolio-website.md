Do you like my website? Would you like to build your own for your own projects?  

I would be thrilled to help!  

## How it works

1. You create a Github account (instructions coming soon)

2. You send me the link

3. I set up your portfolio website and give you all the access you need. You can use a Github URL which costs nothing, or you can use a custom URL which would cost you about $20 a year. 

4. You create the content of your website by creating pages in Markdown and by adding pre-programmed components. 

For example, here's how you would format text:

```
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.
```

And the result: 
Normal paragraph text with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

And here is an example of a pre-programmed component:

```
{% include custom_button.html
   url="mailto:claudielarouche@gmail.com"
   text="Email Me"
   color="blue"
   size="small"
%}
```

{% include custom_button.html
   url="mailto:claudielarouche@gmail.com"
   text="Email Me"
   color="blue"
   size="small"
%}
