## What Is the Free Agent Program?

The **Free Agent Program** is an innovative initiative within the Government of Canada designed to connect highly skilled public servants with short-term, high-impact projects across departments and agencies. As a Free Agent, I bring specialized expertise in IT project management, data analysis, and digital service design to help teams accelerate their goals, share best practices, and deliver value faster.
